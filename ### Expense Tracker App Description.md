### Expense Tracker App Description

The **Expense Tracker Web App** is a personal finance management tool designed to help users track and organize their income and expenses efficiently. Built using modern web technologies, it provides a comprehensive system for managing daily, monthly, and one-time financial activities. Here's a detailed breakdown:

#### 1. **Expense Management**
Users can perform full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for all expenses. Expenses are categorized (e.g., Entertainment, Work, Personal) and tagged with statuses like **PAID**, **PENDING**, **SKIPED**, or **CANCELED**. Each expense can be marked as either a recurring or one-time entry and further classified as obligatory or optional. The app allows for precise tracking of quantities, unit prices, and total payments.

#### 2. **Income Tracking**
The app supports the addition of multiple income sources with details such as amount, date, and whether the income is recurring. Users can easily manage income entries to calculate their total financial inflow.

#### 3. **Dashboard Overview**
The dashboard provides a real-time snapshot of financial data. It gives a breakdown of total monthly expenses, income, and balance, along with the ability to view charts for:
- **Expense categorization**: A pie chart to visualize expenses across categories.
- **Spending trends**: A line chart showing expense patterns over time.
Users can also see specific sections for obligatory and optional expenses to get better financial control.

#### 4. **Filtering and Sorting**
Users can filter expenses based on their type, category, status, or specific date ranges. Sorting options include filtering by status, amount, date, and category, giving users full control over how they view and analyze their data.

#### 5. **Budget Planning**
Monthly budgets can be set for each category. Visual indicators like progress bars notify users when they are approaching or exceeding their budget limits, offering better financial discipline and planning.

#### 6. **Advanced Features**
- **Expense Prioritization**: A drag-and-drop interface helps prioritize expenses manually. The app can also auto-prioritize based on due dates or whether an expense is obligatory.
- **Recurring Transactions**: Automation for recurring expenses like subscriptions or income entries, simplifying the process of tracking routine payments and deposits.
- **Financial Goals**: Users can set savings goals and track their progress, offering motivation to manage and save money effectively.

#### 7. **User Interface**
The interface is clean, modern, and intuitive. The dashboard features light/dark modes, making it adaptable to different environments. Itâ€™s fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across mobile and desktop devices. The expense list view resembles Excel, allowing users to view and update entries with inline editing and collapsible sections.

#### 8. **Data Visualization**
Interactive charts provide valuable insights into spending patterns, expense categories, and trends over time. Users can analyze how their expenses fluctuate and gain a deeper understanding of their financial habits.

#### 9. **Additional Enhancements**
